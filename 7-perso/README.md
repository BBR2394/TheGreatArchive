# Personal Project
 I didn't do enough personal project I think... I have a lot of idea, but , I don't finish it ... Or I don't even start it 
I am going to share my other project or piece of code I have done ^^  
- PX-XL : //TODO add a very short description [PX-XL](https://github.com/BBR2394/PX-XL)
- Anything in C : this is a repo to store all kind of very short, short project or just piece of code made up in C language, for example juste to work with color in terminal, I made some test in C, and store that here  [Anything In C](https://github.com/BBR2394/Anything-in-C)
